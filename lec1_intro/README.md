### Java is an objected oriented language with strict requirements:
#### 1. Every Java file must contain a class declaration*.
#### 2. All CODE lives inside a class*, even helper functions, global constants, etc.
#### 3. To run a Java program, you typically define a main method using:
      public static void main(String[] args)
      
*: We can also declare "interferes" in .java files that may contain code. Will cover this later.      

### About Variables:
#### 5. Before Java variables can be used, they must be declared.
#### 6. Java variables must have a specific type.
#### 7. Java variable types can never change.
#### 8. Types are verified before the code even runs!!!

### About Funtions:
#### 9. Functions must be declared as part of a class in Java.
   A function that is part of a class is called a "method".
   So in Java, all functions are methods.
#### 10. To define a function in Java, we use "public static".
   We will see alternate ways of defining functions later.
#### 11. All parameters of a function must have a declared type,
   and the return value of the function must have a declared type.
   Functions in Java return only one value!
