### Java is an objected oriented language with strict requirements:
#### 1. Every Java file must contain a class declaration*.
#### 2. All CODE lives inside a class*, even helper functions, global constants, etc.
#### 3. To run a Java program, you typically define a main method using:
      public static void main(String[] args)
    
*: We can also declare "interferes" in .java files that may contain code. Will cover this later.
