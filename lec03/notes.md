| Ad Hoc Testing is Not Fun | 注意.equals() 和 '=='、'!='的区别使用 |
| A Simple JUnit Test | org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals() |
| How Selection Sort Works | Selection Sort选择排序<br><b>?invariants?<b>|
| Find Smallest and the Glory of Stack Overflow | Justifying how good JUnit is<br>Simulating how a student programs |
| Recursive Array Helper Methods | In java, no way to get address of the middle of an array:<br>arr[1:]在java中不存在，在python中中存在，即为slice切片<br><b>合理使用helper method，再利用递归循环调用sort(String[] x, int startIndex)<b> |
| <b>Debugging abd Testing, BFFS<b> | Giving me lots of confidence knowing that other people do their coding and <br>debugging just like me.<br>They run into unexpected bugs, they set break points, they step while debug <br>so they get condused and start over again.<br>They frown and be frustrated until find the bugs and fix them. <br>They start coding without thinking thoroughly so they have to fix it little by little,<br>like several helper method can not be connected properly,or missing something<br>in a method definition and have to append the missing part.|
| Reflections on the Process | Same as above |
| Better JUnit | No main method, just @test |
| Testing Philosophy | TDD-Test Driven Development测试驱动开发 |
