###### One of the goals of this project is to get me comfortable working with a big code base that I  don't fully understand, which is going to happen all the time in real world.

###### It is normal to feel overwhelming at first to read the entire spec. 


##### 需要完成Model类中的emptySpaceExists()、maxTileExists()、atLeastOneMoveExists()、tilt()方法，前三个比较简单，最后一个有难度，TA says it will take 3-8 hours, me about more than 3 hours.

##### tilt(Side side)完成游戏的主体逻辑，即数字块上下左右移动至同方向填满空位，相同数字合并，但每次移动同个位置只能合并一次。
